      <h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors
during the middle to
late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the
Permian&#8211;Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all
life on Earth.Radiometric dating of the rock formation that
contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4
million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this
time.Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the
common ancestor of all dinosaurs;if this is true, its traits suggest
that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators.The discovery of
primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such
as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata
supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these
animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.
Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as
evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though
known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to
tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian
relatives.Recently, it has been determined that Staurikosaurus from the
Santa Maria Formation dates to 233.23 Ma, making it older in geologic
age thanE oraptor.</h2>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When dinosaurs appeared, they were not the dominant terrestrial
animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of
archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their
main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as
aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful
than the dinosaurs.Most of these other animals became extinct in the
Triassic, in one of two events. First, at
about 215 million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs,
including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the
Triassic&#8211;Jurassic extinction event (about 200 million
years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early
archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and
rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at least in some
areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and late Norian or earliest
Rhaetian, respectively,and the exact date of their extinction is
uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of
crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles.The
first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and
Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by
occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.Also notably,
there was a heightened rate of extinction during the Carnian Pluvial
Event.</h2>

      <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic follows changes in vegetation and
the location of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic,
the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there
was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of
coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.Gymnosperm
plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in
the late Triassic. Early
sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing
food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking
down food farther along the digestive tract.The general
homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late
Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of
ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and
herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large
sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North
America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show
some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual,
long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and
ornithopods were also becoming more
common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes
were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods,
were not oral processors, but
ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the
mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth,
and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable
evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds,
descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.</h2>

Dinosaurs belong to a group known asa rchosaurs, which also
includes modernc rocodilians. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are
differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend
directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians
sprawl out to either side Collectively, dinosaurs as a clade are
divided into two
primary branches,S aurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia includes
those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with
Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a
more recent common ancestor with Triceratops than with Saurischia.
Anatomically, these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by
their pelvic structure. Early
saurischians&#8212;"lizard-hipped", from the Greek sauros&nbsp; meaning
"lizard" and ischion meaning "hip joint"&#8212;retained the hip structure of
their ancestors, with a pubis bone directed cranially, or
forward. This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to
varying degrees in several groups (Herrerasaurus, therizinosauroids,
dromaeosaurids, and birds). Saurischia
includes the theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of
diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which include
advanced, quadrupedal groups) By contrast,
ornithischians&#8212;"bird-hipped", from the Greek
ornitheios meaning "of a bird" and ischion (&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#943;&#959;&#957;) meaning "hip
joint"&#8212;had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the
pubic bone was oriented caudally
(rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had
an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety
of species which were primarily herbivores. N( B: the terms
"lizard hip" and "bird hip" are misnomers &#8211; birds evolved from
dinosaurs with "lizard hips <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h2>

      <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dinosaurs
are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first
appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million
years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of
dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant
terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic&#8211;Jurassic extinction event
201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic
and Cretaceous periods. Reverse genetic engineering and the fossil
record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs,
having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period.
As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the
Cretaceous&#8211;Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs
can therefore be divided intoa vian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian
dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. This article deals
primarily with non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are a varied group of
animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints.
Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of
vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence,
paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than
1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are
represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and
fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before
birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community
believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most
research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all
dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous
adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others
carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg-laying andnest-building are
additional traits shared by all dinosaurs, avian and non-avian alike.
While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included
quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances.
Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all
dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal
modifications such as bony armor and spines. While the dinosaurs'
modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to
the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and
avian) were large-bodied&#8212;the largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated
to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and
heights of 18 meters (59 feet) and were the largest land animals of all
time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic
is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy
bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs
were quite small: Xixianykus, for example, was only about 50 cm (20 in)
long. Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early
19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major
attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an
enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur
groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have
ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in bestselling books and films,
such as Jurassic Park. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has
resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new
discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</h2>
